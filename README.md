# Windows Login Replica — Preview

> **Status:** Preview / Research demo

## Overview

This repository contains a **preview** of a high-fidelity Windows login UI replica created as a design and research demonstration. The goal of this project is to showcase UI/animation fidelity, polish, and rapid prototyping ability — not to enable or encourage misuse. All artifacts shown here are intended for *controlled lab demonstrations and research only*.

> **Important:** This project is a demonstration. Do **not** run any components on production systems or against devices you do not own or have explicit authorization to test. See the Legal & Ethics section below.

## Preview screenshots

The three screenshots attached to this repo provide a quick glance at the demo:

1. `Screenshot_2025-10-04_07_17_23.png` — Server and client views side-by-side, showing the development/monitoring interface used during demos and the client UI rendered on the test VM.
2. `screenshot_2025.png` — Realistic Windows-style login screen. This image demonstrates the visual polish: animations, spacing, wallpapers, and the password-entry interaction as shown in the preview demo.
3. `screenshot_2025_1.png` — Demo status view indicating a simulated connection state from the test harness. (Shown here as a preview — the repository contains only simulation/demo artifacts.)

> Note: All screenshots are marked as simulation/demo content. Any logged data visible in screenshots is part of a controlled demonstration.

## What this repo demonstrates

* **UI/UX fidelity:** Recreated visual elements, animation timing, and transitions to closely match the look-and-feel of a Windows login experience for design and demonstration purposes.
* **Rapid prototyping:** Built and iterated quickly to validate design choices and animation timing.
* **Demo evidence packaging:** Example of how to present a lab demonstration (video + raw screenshots + annotated notes) for peer review and reproducibility in a controlled environment.

## Legal & Ethics (read first)

* This repository is for **research, design, and defensive demonstration** only. It must never be used to harvest credentials, access systems without authorization, or perform any unauthorized actions.
* If you want to reproduce any aspect of this project for testing, do so in isolated virtual machines or on hardware you own and control. Obtain written authorization before testing on third-party devices or networks.
* The owner/author will not support or endorse any use that violates laws or ethical guidelines. If asked for reproductions or assistance for legitimate, authorized security research, contact the author and provide proper authorization paperwork.

## What I recommend publishing (evidence package)

If you want to make a credible public demo that removes the "staged" claim, publish an evidence bundle that includes:

* Raw demo video and an edited short clip.
* Timestamped raw logs or telemetry extracts (redacted if they contain sensitive data).
* A README describing the lab environment and the scope (clear note: simulation only).
* A VM snapshot or Vagrant/OVA preconfigured to run ONLY the frontend demo in an isolated environment (optional; share only with authorized reviewers).

This repo currently contains a preview glance only — full evidence packages should be shared responsibly and with appropriate legal/ethical safeguards.

## Contribution and disclosure

* This project accepts **design feedback** and engineering suggestions that improve UI fidelity and defensive countermeasures (for example: detection, telemetry, and forensic indicators to help blue teams). Pull requests that attempt to add operational techniques for unauthorized access will be rejected.
* If you discover a real-world vulnerability related to any third-party product, follow responsible disclosure procedures with the affected vendor.

## Changelog (preview)

* `v0.1-preview` — Initial demo: UI replication and preview screenshots added. Further updates will focus on publishing design notes and defensive detection guidance.
